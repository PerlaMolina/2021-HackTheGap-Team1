We want this community to reflect the diversity of the communities where we serve together and the ELCA churches throughout the St Paul Area Synod that come to claim their membership in Shobi’s Table. Just like every community – we start as strangers and continue on as friends, bonded together by the love of Jesus made manifest in every meal.</p>

    <p align="left">Holistic Heaux has recently became a resource for the Black and Brown community within the Twin Cities area since the murder of George Floyd.</p>
          <p align="left">As soon as riots began in our city, we immediately thought of our most vulnerable: mothers/caregivers and children. Where the riots and protests occurred, there are dense populations of Black and Brown families. We support the uprising in all ways, which means ensuring the safety of our Black and Brown youth and women. This is how we began our mutual aid fund.</p>

          <br/>
    <p align="left">Environmental and Outdoor Educators of Minnesota strive to build a deeper appreciation and understanding of our natural world by engaging with children and the public through lessons and outreach programs.  Covid-19 has hit our community of educators hard.  With the spread of the pandemic, many educational facilities throughout the state have had to dramatically scale back their efforts or close their doors completely. </p>
          <p align="left">A majority of environmental educators rely on seasonal positions which do not have safety nets such as unemployment benefits or furlough status.  In an effort to help environmental and outdoor educators survive these setbacks, we are raising money to help supplement the loss of income (relief for loss of income) that has resulted from these Covid-19 related closures.  Our goal is to award $500 grants to 100 educators in need to help survive these trying times.</p>
