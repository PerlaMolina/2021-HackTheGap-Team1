# 2021-HackTheGap-Team1

This is the project my team submitted for the Hack the Gap hackathon in 2021. It is a website titled: "Minnesota Mutual Aid." The website works as an informative and guidance site
 for local aid and charaities, centering on local organizations rather than mainstream ones in order to shine more light on them and bring awareness to their works.
